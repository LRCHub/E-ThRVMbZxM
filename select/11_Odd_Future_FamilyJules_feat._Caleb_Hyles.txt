I keep my ideals set high
So my destiny's never Compromised (what's left to do?)

You need to reap everything that you have sown
Otherwise I wouldn't know if they have grown
Every dream I hold [?]right there in front of me
Take a look into the past
I cannot see where my innocence has ever forsaken me
Telling me to always just believe
Keeping mistakes where they should be
Blurred far in the past

What's goin' on
We're here again
Contemplating existence
Flipping through [?]these doubts of longing for its comfort

What's goin' on
I'm [?]trying out all the words that try holding me down
I am a [?]curse if all come
Fight me

Dreaming of a time when intentions were pure
And good
The world had not infected our hearts and minds
Now we cannot escape this midnight

Futures are not promised they are not given things
[?]We solve
We cannot know what lies ahead
Push back against the notion
That life will have mercy on me

I keep my ideals in line
If I can keep my dreams and aspirations
Filled with the Thought that I will succeed

Dark, I hear the dark sing
As destiny unfurls before me
