You always keep me coming back for more
So many faces in the world but I want yours
The way you make me feel inside my bones
I can't remember how it feels to be alone
And when you call my phone late at night
Anticipation always burns me up inside
Shimmy my way down underground, polluting airways in my wake
Swaying architecture, grappling a birthday cake
It's analogy backfire, in the cliché storm of backwards prose
Shoot the agony beam
Wearing sacrificial clothes
I haven't slept for weeks
Just a couple more and I'll be yours
I'll be coming homing again
And we'll tear apart those sheets
And forget the world, a little while
Get to know your form again
Say the part, say the phrase, say the meaning
I want to hear what you're seeing
Say the part, say the phrase, say the meaning
I want to know what you're feeling
If it's making sense on time, then why do I hear their whines?
If it's moves and breathes it's fine, don't let it mess with your mind
Paging Dr mess your patient's throwing food and ate his robe
You always keep me coming back for more
So many faces in the world but I want yours
The way you make me feel inside my bones
I can't remember how it feels to be alone
And when you call my phone late at night
Anticipation always burns me up inside
Shimmy my way down underground, polluting airways in my wake
Swaying architecture, grappling a birthday cake
It's analogy backfire, in the cliché storm of backwards prose
Shoot the agony beam
Wearing sacrificial clothes
Quantum something can do anything
(Easier said than done)
An accidental public confession was made
(Can't be the only one)
I was in a viper fight, but I'm alright
(That jacket looks good on most people)
Confused cause I'm too dumb to find the light
(Finally exiled)
Overcome by circumstance
I put my life in the devil's hands
Fell lower than before, lower than ever before
I know it's hard to forgive me now, but I swear I've taught myself how
To barricade the door
I won't go there anymore
Overcome by circumstance, separated by consequence
I fell lower than before, lower than I have before
If I could just get through to you, we could put in the final screws
To the barricade the door
And start back where we were
Carcinogenic isotope, we need the A-team montage
Disregard the message from the ending of the album
