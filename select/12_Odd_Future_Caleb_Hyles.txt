Ou ready? Are you excited?
Let's Go-o-o-o
(What's going through?)

This feeling get's me hi-igh
Brighter than the starlight
Confusion no longer leads to panic

If you are in last then take one step
Drowning in yourself, just take one step
Gotta start the progress, take one step
Move on

I guess I've just been down and out for so long
I had forgotten if life had a purpose for me-e
Hindering ourselves, for pity sake
Surrounded by our fears and pain

Dreaming about time when intentions were pure and good
Through our own head
Not infected, our hearts and mind now we can not escape this midnight

Futures are not promised, they are not given things
Resolve we cannot know what lies ahead
Push back against the notion that life will have mercy on me
Ay ay
Ay ay
Oh, Odd future
Ay ay

You need to pick up the thing that you have sown
Otherwise how will one know if they've grown?
Every dream I hold fading in front of me
Take a look into the past
I cannot see where my innocence had ever forsaken me
Telling me to always just believe
Keeping mistakes where they should be: blurred far in the past

What's going on?

I'm here again, contemplating existence
Flipping through nostalgia, longing for its comfort
What's going on
Conformity, yeah that whole life, it was never for me
Think I'll crumble and fall? Not me

Tears. My eyes they blur but don't disapper
The pain reapears
New days to forget my past or to save what little I care for
Do your best!
Are you excited?
The synapses pass in a flash
Let's do this! One last curtain call to reclaim what I left behi-i-ind
Ay ay
Oh, Odd Future

Dreaming ishi gyakusou
Shikakui sora kokoro no sukima umenu
Akenu yoru kara nukeyou
Mirai no kaizoudo sage bokura wa me wo sorashite wa
Naritai mono nante nai to usobuita hibi wo

I Keep my ideals
Sorezore no jinsei
Ai mo yume mo kiken na hodo kantan ni hi ga tsuichau no sa
GONGU nari sorezore no tenmei wo
