I keep my ideals alive
They fuel my life
What's going through?
As soon as you fly hi-igh
You can't deny the starlight
You love the contraction shaking you
Even when ya fail, take ONE STEP
You can breathe again in ONE STEP
It can be that easy in ONE STEP
And that's it
Another day is fading into the night
Ohh it goes on, everyday
All the same, like a game...
But when I close my eyes, I feel alive
And maybe that's the reason why
I'm ... DREAMING!
My mind rewinds,
But still, this endless sky,
It can't fill my heart
So, let's break free,
Escaping the reach of the night
Loses clarity, so – we - just look away for a moment
And we see, thaaaat we can be the heroes straight out of our dreams
AYY-AYyy
AYY-AYyy
Ooh ODD FUTURE
AYY-AYyy
In this world, you're gonna reap what sow
Breaking free from the rust in your soul
Gotta rise from a dark history,
But I fell for these lies,
I believed that I could start again if I threw it all away,
But that mistake, could've sealed my fate
But now, today I've opened up my eyes and I feel so alive
What's going on?!
We've just begun – Everything you've left undone
You can't rewind the days
But you can change your direction
What's going on?!
Cause I can see, that no one else is quite like me
A realm of possibility, and so ... my
Tears, they disappear
The meanings change, and they all fade
New days they're on the horizon
So let's go-oohh
Do your best!
Are you exited?
Coursing through my veins
... So, let's go!
The dark, it won't dare hold us back
AYY-AYyy
AYY-AYyy
Ooh ODD FUTURE
AYY-AYyy
I'm ... DREAMING!
My thoughts rewind,
But still, this endless sky,
It can't fill my heart
So, let's break free,
Escaping the reach of the night
Loses clarity, so – we - just look away for a moment
And we see, thaaaat we can be the heroes straight out of our dreams
I keep my ideals alive
They fuel my life and love,
And I must've somehow lit a spark to feed that fire
I can see the path now,
It's calling out
