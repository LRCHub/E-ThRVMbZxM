Take the car, and turn it into our alibis
Discard the body, pop some pills and you'll be find
Purge, then binge, restart and, insert the sutures
Turn off the lights, I'm watching back to the future
Before we go to far I wont let you take this light
Breath in all mistakes without coming clean
Into hobbling faith. no one I wanna know
Cause we laughed at assimilation
Is this surreal tonight? Well go for all these wins
Is this surreal tonight ill go far and ill ride
Go on a brush me off. Brush me off brush me off
Waltzing right into the bank
They said that you have got a map of my insides
Purge, then binge, pop some pills and you'll be fine
Stay back from our lungs
Coming off the lie I will separate.
It only looks only looks so far well fill these holes
Now I am you
Remove the ribs if you can't lean sideways
I thought my words would have mass appeal
Costs your life, sly as always
I thought my words would have mass appeal
Cover your eyes
I've stabbed you in the back
You stop this, I can't
Please stop me
Right here
I wont do this again
I can't do this, I love you
For all of this shit
Why, why, help
